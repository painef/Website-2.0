      <description>Big data has arrived….and people are drowning in it. One solution is to create a black box. A machine learning algorithm that can synthesize all the data and spit out an answer to any question. But how can non-machines (aka humans) understand and analyze the glut of numbers? The key is to look at indicators. Numbers that can serve as proxies for larger trends and concepts. GDP? An indicator of economic health.</description>

      <description>Someone told me the other day that I’m not good at arguing. Upon reflection, I was forced to agree. So in the spirit of self-improvement I decided to write a series of pieces practicing the art of persuasion. Alas, like my New Year’s resolution to “workout more” this exercise was never started. The problem was that I first needed to answer the root question: why do I want to be good at arguing?</description>

      <description>The American Economics Association needs a code of ethics and conduct. If economists want their work treated with the same respect and consideration as engineering, science, or medicine they must create and achieve certain standards.
There is a joke that goes if you get 3 economists in a room you will get 5 opinions. This criticism, while fair, isn’t actually unique to economics. In engineering, there are multiple solutions to the same problem.</description>
